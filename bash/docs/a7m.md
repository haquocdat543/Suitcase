# ALGORITHM

## 1. algorithms
### 1. binary search
Explain: `Binary search` is a search algorithm used to find the `position of a target` value within a `sorted array`. It works by repeatedly `dividing` the search `interval in half` until the target value is `found` or the interval is `empty`. The search interval is halved by comparing the target element with the middle value of the search space.

Conditions:
* The data structure must be `sorted`.
* Access to `any element` of the data structure takes constant time.
